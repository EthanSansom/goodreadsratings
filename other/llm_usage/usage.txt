Abstract
Although increases in status often lead to more favorable inferences about
quality in subsequent evaluations, in this paper, we examine a setting in which
an increase to an actor’s status results in less favorable quality evaluations,
contrary to what much of sociological and management theory would predict.
Comparing thousands of reader reviews on Goodreads.com of 64 English-
language books that either won or were short-listed for prestigious book
awards between 2007 and 2011, we find that prizewinning books tend to
attract more readers following the announcement of an award and that readers’
ratings of award-winning books tend to decline more precipitously following
the announcement of an award relative to books that were named as finalists
but did not win. We explain this surprising result, focusing on two mechanisms
whereby signals of quality that tend to promote adoption can subsequently
have a negative impact on evaluation. First, we propose that the audience eval-
uating a high-status actor or object tends to shift as a result of a public status
shock, like an award, increasing in number but also in diverse tastes. We out-
line how this shift might translate into less favorable evaluations of quality.
Second, we show that the increase in popularity that tends to follow a status
shock is off-putting to some, also resulting in more negative evaluations. We
show that our proposed mechanisms together explain the negative effect of
status on evaluations in the context of the literary world.

Can you give me some more sources on the impact of awards on the perception of quality?


ChatGPT said:
Here’s a selection of academic and empirical research on how awards affect perceptions of quality or ratings, across books, movies, restaurants, music, and broader quality signals. These studies are useful for building your literature review or situating the Paradox of Publicity paper in a broader context.

🏆 Direct Studies on the Impact of Awards on Quality Perception
🔹 1. Creative Products and Awards
“What Wins Awards Is Not Always What I Buy” — Journal of Consumer Research
Shows that artistic acclaim (e.g., award recognition) doesn’t always translate into greater consumer liking or sales, across multiple domains (music, beer, etc.). It highlights dissociation between expert awards and consumer preferences. 
OUP Academic

🔹 2. Status and Evaluations in Movies
Chui (2024), Shifting evaluations: The impact of status increase on quality evaluations in the movie industry
Finds that Academy Award winners see more reviews and lower average ratings post-award than nominated-only films — very similar to the Goodreads/book finding in Kovács & Sharkey but in film. 
Conscientia Beam

🎬 Film Awards, Signals & Perceptions
🔹 3. General Movie Award Effects
Research shows that major film awards (Oscars, Cannes, festival prizes) act as signals of quality and increase visibility and perceived quality, often translating into box office gains or elevated media attention. 
Number Analytics

🔹 4. Awards & Marketing/Signal Effectiveness
Studies indicate that effectiveness of quality signals depends on credibility and audience expectations — e.g., awards judged by experts influence consumer behavior more than crowd awards. 
Studeersnel

🍽️ Restaurant Awards (Michelin) and Consumer Perception
🔹 5. Michelin Star Effects on Consumer Values
A 2024 empirical study using OpenTable review data finds that receiving Michelin stars increases emotional/hedonic & social consumption values but often doesn’t improve functional quality perceptions like food or ambience. 
ResearchGate

🔹 6. Sentiment & Online Ratings After Michelin Stars
Sentiment analysis of TripAdvisor reviews for Michelin-starred restaurants shows overall sentiment may decline post-award, arguably because of heightened expectations. 
ResearchGate

🔹 7. Consumer Perceptions of Michelin
Quantitative research finds that consumers’ attitudes toward Michelin Guide ratings shape perceived risk and intentions — illustrating how awards act as third-party quality cues. 
ResearchGate

🔹 8. Expert Opinion vs. Consumer Ratings
A 2024 SSRN study using Michelin star changes shows that *decreases in expert rating can actually improve consumer review ratings, suggesting complex interactions between expert signals and consumer expectations. 
SSRN

📊 Other Domains: Music, Science, and General Awards
🔹 9. Music Awards & Demand
A recorded music study finds that winning or being nominated for music awards has weak positive effects on chart performance, with variations by type of prize — useful if you want parallels to book awards. 
Erasmus University Thesis Repository

🔹 10. Scientific Prizes & Topic Growth
Research on scientific awards (Fields, Lasker, etc.) shows prizes can significantly boost research productivity and impact, illustrating awards’ differential long-term influence on perceived value in a domain. 
Nature

🔹 11. The Matthew Effect & Awards
Work on status and cumulative advantage (Matthew effect) shows that prestigious awards can significantly increase attention and subsequent perceived importance of recipients’ work — relevant for framing awards as quality signals. 
PMC

🧠 Theoretical and Review Insights
🔹 12. Awards as Signals of Quality
Multiple literatures (e.g., signalling theory, cue utilization) show that awards serve as extrinsic cues that influence perceived quality and consumer trust, but effects vary by context and consumer expectations. 
ScienceDirect

🔹 13. Downsides of Awards
Popular accounts and syntheses note that winning awards can lead to backlash, higher expectations, and even a decline in perceived quality — aligning with the Goodreads findings.

This paper deals with very few observations, since award winners are by definition rare. Can you find sources mentioning the challenges of conducting an analysis in this case. Preferably, the analysis would explicitly be of winners (and their qualities vs. other contenders), but can be about rare events more generally.


ChatGPT said:

Thought for 28s
Nice — good question. Below I pulled together methodological sources and practical approaches that directly address the problem of doing inference when the “treated” group is tiny (e.g., award winners), and related issues for rare events and small-n causal inference. I grouped the sources by theme and added a one-line note about why each is useful for your literature review or methods section.

Key methodological papers (what to cite & why)
1) Rare-events / small-sample bias in binary models
King & Zeng (2001) — Logistic Regression in Rare Events Data — classic diagnosis and corrections for bias when events are rare; practical for any binary outcome (e.g., winner vs non-winner, rare reviews). 
Gking

Firth (1993) — Bias Reduction of Maximum Likelihood Estimates — introduces the penalized (Firth) likelihood that fixes separation and large bias in small samples; widely recommended for small-sample logit. 
OUP Academic

Applied notes & implementations (reviews / CRAN package): Rainey (2021) and the logistf package documentation describe when to use Firth and how it performs in practice. 
Cambridge University Press & Assessment
+1

Why this matters: if you model a binary outcome (e.g., whether a book wins) or analyze reviewer binary decisions with very few positives, standard MLE can be biased or fail; Firth/King-Zeng provide fixes. 
Gking
+1

2) Inference when there are few treated units (few winners)
Conley & Taber (2011) — Inference with Difference-in-Differences with a Small Number of Policy Changes — offers randomization-style inference tailored to very few treated groups. 
University of Wisconsin Users

Ferman & Pinto (2016/2021) — Inference in DiD with Few Treated Units — shows pitfalls of standard cluster inference and gives alternatives (permutation / randomization inference, adjustments for spatial correlation). 
FEA USP
+1

MacKinnon & Webb (2016/2020) — Randomization inference and bootstrap alternatives (practical guidance for DID & few treated clusters). 
Queen's University Economics
+1

Why this matters: when only a handful of units “receive treatment” (e.g., only a few award winners in a sample), cluster-robust or asymptotic tests often over-reject; these papers offer validated inference alternatives (randomization/permutation tests, tailored bootstrap procedures). 
University of Wisconsin Users
+1

3) Comparative case / single-unit designs (synthetic control & case study inference)
Abadie, Diamond & Hainmueller (2009/2010) — Synthetic Control Methods for Comparative Case Studies — method designed for causal inference with one (or very few) treated units by constructing a synthetic counterfactual from many controls. Good when winners are essentially “case studies.” 
NBER
+1

Reviews & practical guides (Bonander 2021; Urban Institute primer) — explains inference and when SCM is preferable to regression-based DID in small-treated situations. 
PMC
+1

Why this matters: if you want to analyze the effect of a single high-profile winner (or a handful) on outcomes (ratings, citations), synthetic control is a principled option to build a data-driven counterfactual. 
NBER
+1

4) Prize / winner case studies (Nobel and similar) — small-n practical examples
Mazloumian et al. (2011) — How citation boosts promote paradigm shifts and Nobel Prizes — analyzes citation changes around Nobel prizes and discusses methodological choices for sparse event inference. (Good exemplar of prize-effects research.) 
PLOS

Dong et al. (2023) — Nobel citation effects — uses case-study approaches and discusses exchangeability checks and matching for few treated units. 
ScienceDirect
+1

Why this matters: literature that studies Nobel/major prizes often faces exactly your problem (very few laureates), so the methods and sensitivity checks they use are directly transferable to book-award analyses. 
PLOS
+1

5) Randomization / permutation tests and approximate randomization
Canay, Romano & Shaikh (2017) — Randomization Tests under an Approximate Symmetry Assumption — theoretical basis for approximate randomization/permutation tests in clustered/limited settings (useful for few treated units). 
University of Chicago

Related applied work: literature on randomization inference for DID and approximate permutation tests (e.g., Carter et al., induced-order approaches) — good alternatives to asymptotic p-values when treated units are rare. 
Queen's University Economics
+1

Why this matters: when asymptotics fail (few treated), randomization / permutation inference often gives correct type-I error control, provided the assumptions match your design. 
University of Chicago

6) Bayesian hierarchical / small-area modeling (borrowing strength)
National Academies / small-area estimation reviews; Bayesian SAE papers — hierarchical/Bayesian models that “borrow strength” across units to stabilize estimates for rare events or very small subgroups. Useful if you want to estimate winners’ effects while sharing information across books/years. 
The National Academies Press
+1

Why this matters: Bayesian hierarchies provide principled shrinkage and better uncertainty quantification in small-n problems (tradeoff: stronger modelling assumptions). 
NCRM EPrints Repository

7) General reviews on analysis of rare events
Leitgöb (2019) — Analysis of Rare Events (SAGE Methods Foundations) — concise overview of the statistical challenges and choices (ML bias, separation, inference options). 
Academic Web Service

Short practical checklist (applies to award-winner analyses)
Don’t rely on standard asymptotic standard errors if winners are few — cluster-robust or naive t's can be misleading. Consider randomization/permutation inference or tailored bootstrap. 
University of Wisconsin Users
+1

If you model binary rare outcomes, use bias-reduction (King-Zeng correction, or Firth penalized logit). 
Gking
+1

When you have 1–a few treated units across time, synthetic control may give more credible counterfactuals than pooled DID. 
NBER

Use randomization/permutation inference (Conley–Taber, Canay–Romano–Shaikh, MacKinnon) to get valid p-values with few treated clusters. 
University of Wisconsin Users
+2
University of Chicago
+2

Consider Bayesian hierarchical models to borrow strength across books/years if you’re willing to impose structure (helps precision, but check sensitivity). 
NCRM EPrints Repository

Run extensive robustness checks: leave-one-out treated unit checks, placebo tests on controls, pre-trend falsification, and exchangeability checks (used in Nobel studies).

If you want, next I can (pick one):

A. Pull PDFs / DOIs / stable links for any subset of the above and prepare an annotated bibliography (1 paragraph per paper).

B. Draft a methods appendix for your paper describing which of these approaches you used (and why), with suggested robustness checks you should run on your Goodreads award analysis.

C. Try to find examples of book-award studies that explicitly discuss the “few winners” problem (I found Nobel/movie/restaurant work — I can search more specifically for book-award methods papers).

Which of A/B/C should I do now?
